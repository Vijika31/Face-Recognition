# Face-Recognition
Project Title: Face Recognition in ATM Machine

Description:
This project aims to enhance the security and user experience of Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) by integrating face recognition technology. Traditional ATM systems rely solely on PINs or card-based authentication, which can be susceptible to theft or misuse. By incorporating face recognition, the ATM can verify the identity of the user more securely and conveniently, eliminating the need for physical cards or remembering complex PINs.

Key Features:
1. **Face Recognition**: Utilizes advanced facial recognition algorithms to authenticate users.
2. **Security Enhancement**: Adds an extra layer of security to traditional ATM authentication methods.
3. **Convenience**: Provides a more user-friendly and seamless authentication process without the need for physical cards or PINs.
4. **Data Privacy**: Ensures the privacy and security of user biometric data through encryption and secure storage.
5. **Customizable**: Allows for easy integration into existing ATM systems with customizable configurations.
6. **Error Handling**: Implements robust error handling mechanisms to ensure smooth operation and user assistance in case of issues.
7. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation provided to assist with installation, configuration, and usage.


Note: This project is intended for educational purposes and should be used responsibly and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding biometric data and privacy.

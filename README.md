# Face-Recognition
Project Title: Face Recognition in ATM Machine

Description:
This project aims to enhance the security and user experience of Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) by integrating face recognition technology. Traditional ATM systems rely solely on PINs or card-based authentication, which can be susceptible to theft or misuse. By incorporating face recognition, the ATM can verify the identity of the user more securely and conveniently, eliminating the need for physical cards or remembering complex PINs.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:** 
Automated Teller Machines are widely used nowadays by people. But It’s hard to carry their ATM card everywhere, people may forget to have their ATM card or forget their PIN number. The ATM card may get damaged and users can have a situation where they can’t get access to their money. In our proposal, use of biometrics for authentication instead of PIN and ATM card is encouraged. Here, The Face ID is preferred to high priority, as the combination of these biometrics proved to be the best among the identification and verification techniques. The implementation of ATM machines comes with the issue of being accessed by illegitimate users with valid authentication code. The users are verified by comparing the image taken in front of the ATM machine, to the images which are present in the. If the user is legitimate the new image is used to train the model for further accuracy. This system uses openCV to process the image being obtained and Haar Cascade Classifier to detect the faces in the image.

**ABSTRACT**
The face is one of the easiest ways to distinguish the individual identity of each other. Face recognition is a personal identification system that uses personal characteristics of a person to identify the person's identity. Human face recognition procedure basically consists of two phases, namely face detection, where this process takes place very rapidly in humans, except under conditions where the object is located at a short distance away, the next is the introduction, which recognize a face as individuals. Stage is then replicated and developed as a model for facial image recognition (face recognition) is one of the much-studied biometrics technology and developed by experts. There are two kinds of methods that are currently popular in developed face recognition pattern namely, Eigen face method and Fisher face method. Facial image recognition Eigen face method is based on the reduction of face dimensional space using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for facial features. The main purpose of the use of PCA on face recognition using Eigen faces was formed (face space) by finding the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the face image.The project of face detection system with face recognition is Image processing. The software requirements for this project are matlab software.

**OUR SOLUTION:**
Our proposed solution addresses the prevalent issues associated with traditional ATM authentication methods by introducing a robust biometric authentication system centered around face recognition technology. By prioritizing the use of Face ID as the primary authentication method, users can seamlessly access ATM services without the need for physical cards or memorized PINs, thus mitigating the risks of card loss, damage, or forgetting PIN numbers. Through the integration of openCV and Haar Cascade Classifier for face detection and recognition algorithms, our system ensures accurate identification of users while continuously improving its performance through ongoing training with new user images. To bolster security, stringent measures such as multi-factor authentication and encryption of biometric data are implemented to safeguard user privacy and prevent unauthorized access. By prioritizing user experience, our solution aims to streamline ATM transactions, offering a convenient and secure banking experience for all users.

**TECHNOLOGY STACK:**
The technology stack for implementing the proposed biometric authentication system in ATMs includes:
   1. **Face Recognition**: Utilize openCV and Haar Cascade Classifier for face detection and recognition algorithms.
   2. **Backend Development**: Employ Python or a similar programming language for backend development to handle authentication processes and database interactions.
   3. **Database Management**: Use a database system like MySQL or PostgreSQL to securely store user information and biometric data.
   4. **Security Measures**: Implement encryption protocols such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) to protect sensitive biometric data and ensure user privacy.
   5. **Hardware Integration**: Integrate biometric sensors and cameras with ATM machines to capture and process user facial images.
   6. **User Interface**: Design a user-friendly interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for interactions with the ATM system.

By integrating these technologies, the biometric authentication system can effectively authenticate users based on facial recognition, ensuring secure and convenient access to ATM services.

**FLOW OF APPLICATION:**
1. **User Authentication Request**: The user initiates authentication by approaching the ATM machine and selecting the option for biometric authentication.
2. **Face Detection**: The ATM's camera captures the user's facial image, and the system utilizes openCV and Haar Cascade Classifier to detect and extract facial features from the image.
3. **Face Recognition**: The extracted facial features are compared with the stored biometric data of registered users in the database to verify the user's identity.
4. **Authentication Decision**: If the facial features match with the stored data within an acceptable threshold, the user is authenticated, and access to ATM services is granted. Otherwise, access is denied.
5. **Transaction Processing**: Upon successful authentication, the user can proceed with ATM transactions such as cash withdrawals, balance inquiries, or fund transfers.
6. **Security Measures**: Throughout the authentication and transaction process, stringent security measures are implemented to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access or fraudulent activities.
7. **Feedback and Completion**: The user receives feedback on the authentication status and transaction completion, ensuring a seamless and secure banking experience.
8. **Logging and Maintenance**: System logs are maintained to track user activities and ensure system integrity, while regular maintenance and updates are performed to enhance system security and performance.

This flow ensures a secure and efficient biometric authentication process for ATM users, replacing traditional methods such as PINs and physical cards with facial recognition technology.
